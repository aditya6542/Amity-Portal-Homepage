# Amity-Portal-Homepage
This project is a frontend recreation of the Amity University student portal, developed entirely with HTML and CSS. It features a clean, user-friendly interface that mimics the layout and design of the original portal, including navigation menus, login sections, and essential student information displaysâ€”all without any JavaScript or backend functionality. The use of semantic HTML and responsive CSS ensures a visually appealing and accessible experience for users.
